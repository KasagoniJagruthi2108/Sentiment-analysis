Title: Confidence and Emotion Detection in Audio and NLP: A Comparative Study

Introduction:

Define the objectives: To detect both confidence and emotion in audio and text data.
Explain the significance of this project: Improving communication understanding.
Research Phase:

Confidence Detection (Audio-Based and NLP-Based):

Audio-Based: Research various open-source and commercial solutions for confidence detection in audio. Include options like OpenSMILE, CREMA-D, and more. Provide a detailed analysis of each solution, focusing on pros, cons, projected accuracy, and costs. For costs, make assumptions based on a data volume of 100,000 minutes.
NLP-Based: Investigate NLP sentiment analysis tools like VADER, TextBlob, and commercial API solutions (e.g., IBM Watson NLU). Again, provide a detailed analysis of each solution, highlighting pros, cons, projected accuracy, and costs.
Emotion Detection:

Research emotion detection datasets suitable for your project, such as RAVDESS, SAVEE, or others. Evaluate the available datasets and document their features, format, and licensing.
Conclusion:

Summarize the findings, including the optimal solution for confidence detection and the selected dataset for emotion detection.
Prototype Development:

Python Script for Emotion and Confidence Detection:

Input:

Design a Python script that accepts audio files for both emotion and confidence detection.
Users can upload their own audio files.
Emotion Detection:

Use the selected emotion detection dataset.
Extract relevant audio features (e.g., MFCCs) from the audio files.
Train a machine learning model using scikit-learn to classify input audio as "happy" or "sad."
Confidence Detection:

Integrate the optimal confidence detection solution from the research phase.
Printing Results:

Display the predicted emotion in a table with Audio File name in Column A and predicted emotion in Column B.
Create a line chart with "happy" on the positive y-axis and "sad" on the negative y-axis over time.
Print the predicted confidence as a table with appropriate columns.
Generate a line chart showing the confidence trend over time.
Prototype Documentation:

Approach:

Explain that the Python script combines audio-based emotion and confidence detection with NLP sentiment analysis.
Features: Mention that you use MFCCs for audio analysis and NLP sentiment analysis for text data.
Libraries: Specify that you use scikit-learn for emotion detection and the chosen solution for confidence detection.
Challenges Faced:

Document challenges encountered during the development phase.
User Manual:

Inputting Audio Files:

Instruct users on how to provide their audio files and specify the accepted audio file formats (e.g., WAV, MP3).
Running the Script:

Provide steps for running the Python script in their Python environment.
Printing Results:

Explain how to interpret the printed results, including emotion and confidence tables and line charts.
Please note that both the research and prototype development require considerable effort, and the quality of results will depend on the quality of the datasets and the chosen tools and models for emotion and confidence detection.
